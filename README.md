# Sales Analysis in USA 


## Project Overview 

Retail businesses operate in a highly dynamic environment where performance varies across regions, products, customer types, and time. To remain competitive and profitable, it's essential to track **key performance indicators** such as **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Order Quantity** in a timely and organized way.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- Monitor business performance across four key regions: **Central, East, South, and West**
- Filter data by **year** to analyze trends over time
- Dynamically switch between **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity** views for deeper insights
- Compare current year sales with **Previous Year (PY)** to evaluate growth or decline

By making regional and metric-specific performance instantly accessible, the dashboard supports better planning, strategic decision-making, and performance optimization at both regional and national levels.
