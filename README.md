# Sales Analysis in USA 


## Background && Overview 

In a rapidly changing business environment, tracking performance metrics such as **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity Sold** is crucial for timely and informed decision-making. Companies operating across multiple regions often struggle with gaining a consolidated yet flexible view of key performance indicators (KPIs).

This Power BI dashboard was designed to address this challenge by providing a **dynamic and interactive reporting tool** that enables users to:

- Monitor business performance across four key regions: **Central, East, South, and West**
- Filter data by **year** to analyze trends over time
- Dynamically switch between **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity** views for deeper insights
- Compare current year sales with **Previous Year (PY)** to evaluate growth or decline

By making regional and metric-specific performance instantly accessible, the dashboard supports better planning, strategic decision-making, and performance optimization at both regional and national levels.
